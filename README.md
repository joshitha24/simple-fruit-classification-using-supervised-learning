📝 About
This project builds a Logistic Regression model to classify different types of fruits based on features like weight and color.
It walks through the full machine learning pipeline, including:
Data loading and preprocessing,
Train-test splitting,
Model building,
Prediction and 
Model evaluation

It’s a great project to understand supervised learning basics using Scikit-learn.

▶️ How to Run
Open your terminal or Jupyter Notebook.
Run the Python file:
supervised_fruit classification.ipynb
Or open the notebook and run the cells.

📈 Results
Achieved a good classification accuracy on test data.
Understood the concepts of:
Logistic Regression,
Train/Test split,
Prediction and 
Model evaluation using the accuracy score.
